    "### A MINI Tutorial on selenium, a framework that allows us to interact with HTML elements on any website\n",
    "### Description: \n",
    "Not only does Selenium provide web scraping tools, it also gives us the ability to mimic a normal browsing interaction, like clicking on a link, typing in a text area, dragging and dropping, and much more. In this mini tutorial, we'll use Selenium to perform the following tasks:\n",
    "* Access a membership website and log in by 'typing' our login credentials and  'clicking' the login button\n",
    "* Navigate to 100+ webpages within the website via automated clicks and collect some data (100+ urls)\n",
    "* Automate the download of 100+ videos located on different webpages, and organize them in specific files\n",
    "* Create a script to download future uploads<br>\n",
    "Before we get started, you'll need the following:\n",
    "* Download and install the Selenium libraries (use the following command to install selenium: _pip install selenium_)\n",
    "* A web driver, which selenium will use to browser the internet. I'm using a chrome driver, which you can download [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)\n",
    "* You also need to install vimeo downloader for downloading videos directly from vimeo(use the following command:_pip install vimeo-downloader_)\n",
    "<p>Okay, we're ready to go! Uncomment the following cell and run it to download _selenium_ and _vimeo-downloader_. Then we'll perform some necessary imports. <br>\n"
